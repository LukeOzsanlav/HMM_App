# HMM Explorer üó∫Ô∏èü¶Ö
## Interactively fit hidden markov models to animal movement tracks
This app is designed to let users explore the application of hidden markov models to animal movement data. The models are fit using the `MoveHMM` R package and visualizations are provided throughout to help users understand the model fitting process

<br/>

## The Workflow
                                        
#### Step 1- Data Vis

#### Step 2- Segment Data

#### Step 3- Run HMM Model

#### Step 4- HMM Model Checks

## App Details
### Functionality ‚öíÔ∏è
The app intended to allow users to explore the fitting of hidden markov models to animal movement tracks from a single individuals. The app has the following functionality:
* Visualize tracks in interactive map
* Fit Hidden markov models
  * Choose number of hidden states
  * Alter state starting parameters
* Visualize model outputs
  * Interactive map of decoded state
  * Step length and turning angle distributions by state
  * Model checks
